        <p>When you think of buying a personal computer, the OS  (operating system) often comes to mind. Should you buy a Windows or a Mac? </p>
        <p>Both operating systems have been used since the beginning of  the computer age. Although other operating systems like Linux are used by some  individuals, most computer users deem themselves either a &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; or a &ldquo; PC&rdquo;  user. But lately, a &ldquo;new kid on the block&rdquo; seems to be making headlines,  especially since the current state of the world is keeping most kids at home  from school. </p>
        <p>This sort of newcomer is the Chromebook. Chromebook uses the  Chrome OS from Google and has been in the market since 2011. However, in 2020  its sales soared, mostly due to its low-cost and popular use in schools. (  see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/chrome-os/chromebook/239021/chromebook-sales-growth-outpaced-laptops-by-3x-in-u-s">https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/chrome-os/chromebook/239021/chromebook-sales-growth-outpaced-laptops-by-3x-in-u-s</a>)  . </p>
        <p>But should you buy a Chromebook? It really depends on your  computer needs. If you are an elementary school students taking virtual classes  and rely on connecting to google classroom for your daily activities, this  device may be perfect for you. </p>
        <p>Before making a decision of purchasing a Chromebook as your  first computer or switching to a Chromebook from your current computer, it is  important to research about Chromebooks capabilities. It also may be beneficial  to try out the OS either by visiting a retail store or even watching a few  videos that showcase its performances.        </p>

<h1>Quantum Computers: Future pcs?</h1>
        <p>A new trend in the industry that has been making headlines  and influencing computer engineers in many parts of the world is quantum  computing.</p>
        <p>For many, it may seem that quantum computers are the same as  supercomputers; however, they are largely different. </p>
        <p>While supercomputers use the same principles as any regular,  day to day computers, Quantum computers operate in a very different format.  Instead of using bits like more computers, quantum computers use qubits, such  as electrons or protons. It is a fascinating subject. </p>
        <p>Although quantum computer will probably not replace our  personal computers, it promises to advance many industries such as  pharmaceutical industries.</p>

        <h1>Have you heard of virtual reality?</h1>
        <p><img src="style/Vr2.png" alt="" width="238" height="148" align="left"/></p>
        <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In  a world where travelling is not recommended, technology continues to bring new  forms of entertainment into vogue. Virtual reality, a computer simulation of  reality, has been around for a few years now. Still, it has attracted attention  in many different fields in the past year as people continue to stay home in  many countries. By using an app on your phone or, for the more immersive  experiences, special equipment, a user can enter and interact in a completely  different reality. This may be in the user&rsquo;s own city or thousands of miles  away. The possibilities are endless.</span>        </p>
