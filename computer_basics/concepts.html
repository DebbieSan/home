        <h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Computers are everywhere &ndash; A look today&rsquo;s computer options</span></strong><br>
        </h2>
        <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><u>Personal Computers (PC) - A computer for your everyday needs, choose between desktop-based or portable.</u></span></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Desktop computers:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;Like its name, it is a computer intended to be used on a desk. It is usually bigger than portable computers and often has more flexibility for hardware updates (although many portable computers allow for updates). Desktop computers may also be more cost-effective if you are looking for more power, such as what is required for playing many computer games.</span></li>
          <li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Portable Computers:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;Just like its name, it is a computer made to be easily transported. Comes in many different sizes:</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some options for portable computers are Laptop and Tablet computers.</span>        </p>
        <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">* A laptop computer is usually the bigger of the portable devices and usually more potent. Because of its potential for hardware updates, it is also the most comparable to desktop computers.</span></p>
        <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">* Tablet computers can be the same size as laptop computers or smaller. Unlike laptop or desktop computers, it does not have a keyboard and mouse or touchpad as it uses a touchscreen. A touchscreen is optimally used with a stylus but can also be used with fingers.</span>        </p>
        <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><u>Mobile Devices</u></span></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mobile devices are small, portable devices used as computers or to access the internet. Today, the most popular mobile devices are phones. Many computer users rely on their phones for everyday computing needs such as emailing, reading webpages or playing games. These phones are often called &ldquo; smartphones.&rdquo;</span></li>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other mobile devices for internet usage and other computing needs are smartwatches, tablets, e-readers and many others.</span><br>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong><u>Embedded Computers</u></strong></span><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A type of computer that may not come to mind when you think of a computer are embedded computers. Embedded computers are tiny computers embedded into devices to perform a specific task. They can be found in common kitchen appliances such as air fryers and microwaves, gym equipment such as ellipticals or stair climbers, and vehicles such as the devices inside mirrors to alert drivers of a blind spot.</span><br>

        <ul>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A computer is used to host programs and data for a small network.</span></li>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Usually bigger, more powerful and expensive than desktop computers.</span></li>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Frequently used in schools and small businesses but also available for home use.</span><br>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong><u>Mainframe computers</u></strong></span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Powerful computers are used by large organizations such as universities, hospitals, banks and government agencies.</span></li>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More powerful than servers</span></li>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Manage large amounts of centralized data</span></li>
          <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Usually located in secured, climate-controlled data centres within the organization it belongs to.</span><br>
